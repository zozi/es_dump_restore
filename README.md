# es_dump_restore

A utility for safely dumping the contents of an ElasticSearch index to a compressed file and restoring it
later on.  This can be used for backups or for cloning an ElasticSearch index without needing to take down
the server.

The file format is a ZIP file containing the index metadata, the number of objects in the index, and a
series of commands to be sent to the ElasticSearch bulk API.

## Installation

    gem install es_dump_restore

## Usage

To dump an ElasticSearch index to a file:

    es_dump_restore dump ELASTIC_SEARCH_SERVER_URL INDEX_NAME DESTINATION_FILE

To restore an index to an ElasticSearch server:

    es_dump_restore restore ELASTIC_SEARCH_SERVER_URL DESTINATON_INDEX FILENAME
